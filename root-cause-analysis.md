# Root Cause Analysis Report

## Overview

This report analyzes the CI/CD pipeline and Vercel deployment failures in the Digital Brain Agency project. The analysis is based on examination of configuration files, workflow definitions, recent code changes, and deployment settings.

## Key Issues Identified

### 1. Merge Conflicts

**Severity: Critical**

The most recent commit (62bf89d) contains numerous unresolved merge conflicts that were committed to the repository. These conflicts are present in:

- `package-lock.json`: Extensive conflicts in dependency versions
- `src/components/VoiceChatBot.tsx`: Two different implementations of the component
- `src/pages/Index.tsx`: Conflicting page implementations
- `vercel.json`: Conflicting deployment configurations

These merge conflicts are causing build failures as the code cannot be properly parsed or executed.

### 2. Configuration Mismatches

**Severity: High**

There are critical mismatches between different configuration files:

- `vercel.json` specifies `"outputDirectory": "dist"`, but Next.js typically outputs to `.next`
- `next.config.js` has `output: 'standalone'` which creates a different output structure
- The build command in `vercel.json` is `"buildCommand": "npm run build"`, but the CI workflow has additional steps

### 3. Environment Variable Issues

**Severity: High**

- Missing environment variables in Vercel deployment
- The CI/CD workflow references environment variables that may not be properly configured in Vercel
- Sensitive API key (GEMINI_KEY) is hardcoded in `.env.local` rather than being stored as a secret

### 4. Deployment Script Failures

**Severity: Medium**

- The deployment workflow attempts to run scripts that may not exist or have errors:
  - `ts-node scripts/run-analyzer.ts`
  - `ts-node scripts/run-security-analysis.ts`
  - `ts-node scripts/check-deployment-readiness.ts`
- These scripts reference modules that may not be properly imported or configured

### 5. Build Output Path Issues

**Severity: High**

- Vercel deployment is looking for build artifacts in the `dist` directory
- Next.js is configured to output to a different location
- This mismatch causes Vercel to fail to find the build artifacts

## Detailed Analysis

### Merge Conflict Analysis

The merge conflicts appear to stem from merging the `main` branch into a development branch without properly resolving conflicts. The commit message "Resolve merge conflicts from main branch" suggests an attempt was made to resolve these conflicts, but the conflicts were actually committed to the repository.

The VoiceChatBot component has two completely different implementations:
- One implementation uses a simple fixed-position chat interface
- The other uses a more complex interface with avatars and additional features

### Configuration Analysis

The project has undergone several changes to its Vercel configuration:
1. Initial configuration with `.next` as the output directory
2. Changed to exclude certain directories
3. Updated to use a more complex configuration with builds, rewrites, and headers
4. Most recent change added conflicting settings

The `next.config.js` file has also been modified to change experimental features and optimization settings.

### Environment Variable Analysis

The CI/CD workflow requires several environment variables for the build process:
- NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
- NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
- NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN
- NEXT_PUBLIC_ENVIRONMENT
- NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_RELEASE
- NEXT_PUBLIC_VERSION

For Vercel deployment, additional variables are needed:
- VERCEL_TOKEN
- VERCEL_ORG_ID
- VERCEL_PROJECT_ID

For Supabase database migrations:
- SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN

Some of these may be missing or incorrectly configured in the Vercel project settings.

### Deployment Script Analysis

The deployment workflow attempts to run several TypeScript scripts:
- `run-analyzer.ts`: Analyzes the codebase for issues
- `run-security-analysis.ts`: Performs security checks
- `check-deployment-readiness.ts`: Verifies deployment readiness

These scripts may have dependencies that are not properly installed or configured in the CI environment.

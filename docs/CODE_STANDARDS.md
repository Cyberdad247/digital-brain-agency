# Code Standards and Best Practices

## TypeScript Guidelines

### Type Definitions
- Use interfaces for object definitions that will be extended
- Use type aliases for union types and complex type compositions
- Avoid using `any` type; prefer `unknown` for truly unknown types
- Make use of generics for reusable type patterns

### Class Structure
- Follow SOLID principles
- Keep classes focused and single-responsibility
- Use abstract classes for shared behavior
- Implement interfaces for consistent contracts

### API Module Standards
- Use consistent error handling patterns
- Implement proper type checking
- Document all public methods and interfaces
- Use async/await for asynchronous operations

## Styling Practices

### Component Structure
- Use functional components with hooks
- Implement proper prop typing
- Keep components small and focused
- Use composition over inheritance

### CSS/SCSS Guidelines
- Follow BEM naming convention
- Use CSS modules for component-specific styles
- Implement responsive design patterns
- Maintain consistent spacing and sizing units

## Code Organization

### Directory Structure
- Group related features in feature folders
- Separate business logic from UI components
- Keep shared utilities in dedicated folders
- Maintain clear import paths using aliases

### File Naming
- Use PascalCase for component files
- Use camelCase for utility files
- Add type definitions in separate .d.ts files
- Use meaningful and descriptive names

## Testing Standards

### Unit Tests
- Write tests for all business logic
- Use meaningful test descriptions
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange-Act-Assert)
- Maintain high test coverage

### Integration Tests
- Test component integration points
- Verify API interactions
- Test error handling scenarios
- Implement E2E tests for critical paths

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization
- Implement code splitting
- Use lazy loading for routes
- Optimize bundle size
- Implement proper caching strategies

### Security
- Implement proper input validation
- Use secure authentication methods
- Follow OWASP guidelines
- Regular security audits

## Dependency Management

### Package Guidelines
- Keep dependencies up to date
- Regularly audit for vulnerabilities
- Document major version updates
- Maintain lock files

### Version Control
- Write meaningful commit messages
- Follow conventional commits
- Use feature branches
- Regular code reviews

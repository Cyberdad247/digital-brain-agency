# Supabase Configuration Analysis

1. Confirm that sensitive keys (SUPABASE_URL and SUPABASE_KEY) are imported from environment variables.
2. Check that the Supabase client initialization uses these environment variables.
3. Review security practices to ensure API keys are not exposed in client-side code.
4. Validate that configuration settings match the target Supabase project.

## Project info

**URL**: https://lovable.dev/projects/3a687ab7-9e0d-43e3-a3c2-8ea133f55e56

## Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Create a `.env` file based on the `.env.example` file.
4. Start the development server using `npm run dev`.

## Scripts

- `npm start`: Start the application.
- `npm run dev`: Start the application in development mode.
- `npm test`: Run tests.

## Environment Variables

- `PORT`: The port on which the server runs.
- `NODE_ENV`: The environment mode (development or production).
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: API key for OpenAI.
- `DATABASE_URL`: URL for the PostgreSQL database.
- `ANALYTICS_SERVICE`: URL for the analytics service.
- `GOOGLE_API_KEY`: API key for Google services.
- `SUPABASE_URL`: URL for Supabase.
- `SUPABASE_KEY`: API key for Supabase.

## Usage

- Start the project with `bun run dev`.
- For backend, run `bun run dev:backend`.

## Testing

- Execute tests using `bun run test`.

## Testing Configuration

To configure and run tests, follow these steps:

1. Ensure all dependencies are installed:

```sh
bun install
```

2. Run the tests:

```sh
bun run test
```

3. Check the test results and ensure all tests pass. If any tests fail, review the error messages and fix the issues before running the tests again.

## Deployment

- Build the project with `bun run build`.
- Follow your hosting providerâ€™s guidelines to deploy the build output.

**Using Lovable**

- Open [Lovable](https://lovable.dev/projects/3a687ab7-9e0d-43e3-a3c2-8ea133f55e56)
- Click on Share -> Publish

**Local Deployment**

1. Build the project:

```sh
bun run build
```

2. Deploy the generated `dist` folder to your preferred hosting provider (Vercel, Netlify, etc.)

## Deployment Commands

To deploy the latest changes to Vercel, use the following commands:

```sh
git add .
git commit -m "Deploying latest changes"
git push origin main  # Assuming 'main' is your branch
vercel --prod  # This command triggers the deployment on Vercel
```

## Verifying File Structure

Make sure that the files you are trying to access exist in the specified paths. For example, if you are trying to access an API endpoint, ensure that the corresponding JavaScript file exists in the `backend/api/` directory.

## Checking Deployment Logs

Go to your Vercel dashboard and check the deployment logs for any errors or warnings that might indicate what went wrong during the deployment process.

## Testing Locally

Run your application locally to ensure that everything works as expected before deploying. You can use a local server to test your API endpoints.

## API Usage

To use the API endpoint, make sure your server is running and accessible. You can test the endpoint using tools like `curl` or Postman.

Example using `curl`:

```sh
curl -X GET https://your-vercel-app-url/api/voice
```

Replace `https://your-vercel-app-url` with your actual deployed URL. **Note:** Do not run the URL as a command in your terminal. Instead, use a web browser or an API testing tool to access the endpoint.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter an error like `CommandNotFoundException`, ensure that you are not trying to run the URL as a command in your terminal. Instead, use a web browser or an API testing tool to access the endpoint.
